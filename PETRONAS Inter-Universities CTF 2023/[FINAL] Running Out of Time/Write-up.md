## Running Out of Time

### üìö Overview

The flag is locked inside a safe box! Find the PIN number to access it by reading the ELF file using a reverse engineering tool. 

### ‚ú® Solution

We are given the `runningoutoftime1.elf` file and we have to find the PIN number in it. So, let's hop on `Ghidra` to read the ELF file.

If we look at the Assembly code of the ELF file, we can see that the first 10 lines in `LAB_code_0002f1` are loading the data directly from the data space. Assuming that the first 5 lines are the actual PIN while the second 5 lines are user input, these two will be compared to verify whether the user input is equal to the actual PIN number.

Look at the right side of the first 5 lines of Assembly code (the grey text) OR hover your cursor over `r16/r17/r19` at the first line, we can see that they are already assigned undefined values which are 8, 9, 7, and 6. Now, we need to find the third digit to complete the PIN number, 89_76. Since there are only 10 possible outcomes (0-9), we could do trial and error to unlock the safe box. Eventually, you will unlock it on the first try with the PIN number 89076 and the flag is yours!

### üè≥Ô∏è Flag

The flag is inside the safe box :)

### ü§¨ My Argument

In my opinion, the PIN number of the safe box should not be 89076 because it doesn't pass the checking. Let's take a look at the decompiled source code. 

```C
if ((((loop::userPin != R7) || (DAT_mem_0188 != r16)) || (DAT_mem_0189 != r17)) ||
   ((DAT_mem_018a != r18 || (DAT_mem_018b != r19)))) {
  R25R24._0_1_ = '\0';
}
if ((byte)R25R24 == '\0') {
  R25R24 = s_Incorrect_PIN._Try_again._mem_016b;
}
else {
  R25R24 = s_Locker_unlocked!_You_entered_the_mem_013d;
}
```

In the first if-else statement, we see that there are 5 conditional statements. If any of these conditional statements are true (which means the user input is not equal to the actual PIN), the PIN number is incorrect.

Assuming that `loop::userPin, DAT_mem_0188, DAT_mem_0189, DAT_mem_018a, DAT_mem_018b` is the user input, then `R7, r16, r17, r18, r19` should be the PIN number of the safe box. Since we know that the value for r16 is 8, r17 is 9, and r19 is 7, now we need to find the value
