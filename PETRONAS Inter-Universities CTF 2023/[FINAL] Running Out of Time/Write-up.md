## Running Out of Time

### üìö Overview

The flag is locked inside a safe box! Find the PIN number to access it by reading the ELF file using a reverse engineering tool. 

### ‚ú® Solution

We are given the `runningoutoftime1.elf` file and we have to find the PIN number in it. So, let's hop on `Ghidra` to read the ELF file.

If we look at the Assembly code of the ELF file, we can see that the first 10 lines in `LAB_code_0002f1` are loading the data directly from the data space. Assuming that the first 5 lines are the actual PIN while the second 5 lines are user input, these two will be compared to verify whether the user input is equal to the actual PIN number.

Look at the right side of the first 5 lines of Assembly code (the grey text) OR hover your cursor over `r16/r17/r19`, we can see that they are already assigned undefined values which are 8, 9, 7, and 6. Now, we need to find the third digit to complete the PIN number, 89_76. Since there are only 10 possible outcomes (0-9), we could do trial and error to unlock the safe box. Eventually, you will unlock it on the first try with the PIN number 89076 and the flag is yours!

The flag is inside the safe box :)

### ü§¨ My Argument

In my opinion, the PIN number of the safe box should not be 89076 because it doesn't pass the checking. Let's take a look at the function graph.

We could see that `r16, r17, r18, r19, r20` are loaded into `R18, R20, R22, Zlo, Xlo` and `loop::userPin, DAT_mem_0188, DAT_mem_0189, DAT_mem_018a, DAT_mem_018b` are loaded into `R25, R19, R21, R23, Zhi` respectively. After that, the Assembly code moves the content of `R7` into `R24` and then it's gonna compare `R25, R19, R21, R23, Zhi` with `R24, R18, R20, R22, Zlo` respectively. 

However, `Xlo` that holds the content of `r20`, which is 6 (the last digit of the PIN number) is not present in the comparison and there is a new number that was supposed to be a part of the PIN number as the first digit which is `R24` that holds the content of `R7`. Thus, we could say 89076 is the incorrect PIN. 

Then, what is the PIN number of the safe box? Let's take a look at the decompiled source code. 

```C
if ((((loop::userPin != R7) || (DAT_mem_0188 != r16)) || (DAT_mem_0189 != r17)) ||
   ((DAT_mem_018a != r18 || (DAT_mem_018b != r19)))) {
  R25R24._0_1_ = '\0';
}
if ((byte)R25R24 == '\0') {
  R25R24 = s_Incorrect_PIN._Try_again._mem_016b;
}
else {
  R25R24 = s_Locker_unlocked!_You_entered_the_mem_013d;
}
```

In the first if-else statement, we see that there are 5 conditional statements. If any of these conditional statements are true (which means the user input is not equal to the actual PIN), the PIN number is incorrect.

Assuming that `loop::userPin, DAT_mem_0188, DAT_mem_0189, DAT_mem_018a, DAT_mem_018b` is the user input, then `R7, r16, r17, r18, r19` should be the PIN number of the safe box. Since we know that the values for `r16 = 8, r17 = 9, and r19 = 7`, we need to find the values of `R7` and `r18` to complete the PIN number, _89_7.

In line 83 of the decompiled source code, we can see that the variable `R7` is assigned with a value `'\x01'` which is 1 in hexadecimal thus making the PIN number 189_7. Hence, we can do trial and error to unlock the safe box. By any chance if `r18 = 0` just like in the Solution section, then the PIN number is 18907.
